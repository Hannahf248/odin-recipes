    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 Before you start cooking,
        take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air. Add
        your ground smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go
        easy!), ground coriander, dried oregano, ground cumin, a pinch of sugar
        and salt and a generous grind of black pepper to a plate and give
        everything a good mix up – this is your Cajun-style spice mix.
      </li>

      <li>
        Press one side of your chicken breast portion[s] into the Cajun-style
        spice mix and save the rest of the spice mix for later – this is your
        Cajun-style spiced chicken.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of
        vegetable oil over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the Cajun-style
        spiced chicken, spice-side down, and cook for 3 min or until slightly
        charred, then once charred, transfer the chicken, spice-side up, to a
        baking tray and reserve the pan for later Put the tray in the oven for
        15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the
        juices run clear.
      </li>

      <li>
        Meanwhile, boil a kettle Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]. Peel
        and finely chop (or grate) your garlic. Deseed your sweet pointed
        pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into
        thin strips.
      </li>

      <li>
        Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil
        Once hot, add the sliced red onion, chopped garlic, pepper strips and
        remaining Cajun-style spice mix and cook for 8-10 min or until starting
        to soften.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt
        and bring to the boil over a high heat. Cook the linguine for 8-10 min
        or until cooked with a slight bite, then drain it, reserving a cup of
        starchy pasta water. Reboil half a kettle. Dissolve your chicken stock
        mix and soft cheese in 200ml [260ml] [340ml] boiled water – this is your
        creamy stock.
      </li>

      <li>
        Once the veg has softened, add your Chinese rice wine and cook for 30
        secs or until evaporated. Add the creamy stock and cook for 2-3 min
        further or until thickened. Once thickened, add the drained linguine and
        give everything a good mix up – this is your creamy Cajun-style pepper
        linguine. Tip: Add a splash of the starchy pasta water if it's looking a
        little dry. On a clean board, slice the cooked spiced chicken finely
        Serve the sliced spiced chicken over the creamy Cajun-style pepper
        linguine. Season with a crack of black pepper. Enjoy!
