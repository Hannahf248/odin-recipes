    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      To make your own BBQ pizza, you'll spread sticky homemade BBQ sauce over a
      flame-baked pizza base, and top with pan-fried free range chicken breast
      and fresh mozzarella. Then just bake, slice and serve. Smokin'!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tomato paste (32g)</li>
      <li>British chicken breast portions (2pcs)</li>
      <li>Flame-baked pizza bases (2pcs)</li>
      <li>Ground smoked paprika (1tsp)</li>
      <li>Chipotle paste (20g)</li>
      <li>Green pepper</li>
      <li>Mozzarella (25g)</li>
      <li>Garlic clove</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6. Take your chicken out of
        the fridge, open the packet and let it air. Put a large baking tray (or
        two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom from going
        soggy!). Slice your free range chicken breast portion[s] into thin
        strips.
      </li>

      <li>
        Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a
        teaspoon), then chop into small, bite-sized pieces. Peel and finely chop
        (or grate) your garlic.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of
        olive oil over a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the sliced chicken and
        chopped pepper with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min on each side or
        until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!).
      </li>

      <li>
        Meanwhile, add your tomato paste to a jug with your ground smoked
        paprika, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), chopped
        garlic and a generous grind of black pepper. Add 5 tbsp [7 1/2 tbsp] [10
        tbsp] cold water and stir it all together – this is your BBQ sauce.
      </li>

      <li>
        Drain your mozzarella, then pat it dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as
        much liquid out as you can!). Tear the drained mozzarella into rough,
        bite-sized pieces.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s].
        Divide the BBQ sauce between the pizza base[s] and spread it evenly all
        over them with the back of a spoon. Top with the torn mozzarella.
      </li>

      <li>
        Once the chicken is done, divide the cooked chicken & pepper evenly
        between the pizza base[s]. Put the tray[s] in the oven for 12-15 min or
        until the mozzarella has melted and the pizza base[s] is crisp – this is
        your smoky BBQ free range chicken pizza. Serve the smoky BBQ free range
        chicken pizza with a generous grind of black pepper. Enjoy!
